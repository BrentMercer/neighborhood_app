# Colorado Springs Neighborhood Micro Brewery App

![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

> Developed for the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**.

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It challenges students to create a web application from Google Map API, as well as one additional API. For my project, I chose to include Foursquare's API.

This app helps users find some of the best micro breweries in Colorado Springs (the ones I've tried anyway), based on my personal favorites.

The app allows users to see a list of good breweries, better breweries, the best breweries, or all the breweries in CS.

Users can see their geographical location on a Google Map and click the location to see additioanl information about the brewery selected.

The app is responsive and should lood great on any screen size.

## How To Use

1. Click here to try it out: ‚û°  <http://lastres0rt.github.io/udacity-neighborhood-map-project/> 
2. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information
3. Type in the white bar if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot.

Updated with new location of Hacker Dojo (old one has been left intact for historical purposes) üë©üèΩ‚Äç

# Future Improvements
 
I'd like to get this set up with Gulp so I can automate adding new locations and make updating this app easier! That'd be awesome.

I'd also like to add some new flourishes... this app seems to be getting forked a fair bit, and I'm hoping that's not because of anything that wouldn't be "Udacious"...
