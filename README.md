# Colorado Springs Neighborhood Micro Brewery App

![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

> Developed for the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**.

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It challenges students to create a web application from Google Map API, as well as one additional API. For my project, I chose to include Foursquare's API.

This app helps users find some of the best micro breweries in Colorado Springs (the ones I've tried anyway), based on my personal favorites.

The app allows users to see a list of good breweries, better breweries, the best breweries, or all the breweries in CS.

Users can see their geographical location on a Google Map and click the location to see additioanl information about the brewery selected.

The app is responsive and should lood great on any screen size.

## How To Use

1. Click here to try it out: âž¡  <http://lastres0rt.github.io/udacity-neighborhood-map-project/> 
2. Click on a brewery from the list or a marker on the map for more information.
3. Click on one of the filter buttons to see good, better, the best, or all the breweries on Colorado Springs.

## Future Improvements
 
Get more CS breweries enetered into the app.

Create back end and interface so users can enter breweries on their own.

Create search filter.

Create logic to organize good, better, best breweries by star rating - maybe rating from Yelp or maybe an aggregate (like Metacritic).
